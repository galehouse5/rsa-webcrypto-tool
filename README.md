# rsa-webcrypto-tool
HTML / JavaScript tool that does RSA encryption, decryption, and key generation using the Web Crypto API. There are many other tools like it but none I found that are hosted on GitHub Pages, which offers transparency you can trust (if you trust GitHub). Also, I had trouble finding a web-based tool that performs asymmetric encryption on files.
